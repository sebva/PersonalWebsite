CarCounter is an application capable of counting how many cars pass in front of a highway security camera. It can process a video stream up to 1080p30 in real-time.

The application is developed using the CUDA GPGPU technology, enabling massively parallel computations on graphics cards.

The project was developed in collaboration with [Jason Racine](http://www.jason-racine.com/).
