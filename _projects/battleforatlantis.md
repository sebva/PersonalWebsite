Battle for Atlantis is a two-player game played on two computers. It is a derivative of the [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) board game. Battle for Atlantis adds a story: both players compete to get first to the Atlantis. The game is played on three levels: surface, submarine and the Atlantis.

The game was developed in Java. Players computers communicate via TCP/IP using a custom protocol based on JSON. 

The project was developed in collaboration with Jason Racine and [Johan Chavaillaz](https://chavaillaz.com/website/).
