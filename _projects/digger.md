The aim of the ["Outil d’aide au déminage" project](https://dtr.digger.ch/dtr/products-and-services/smart-mdd/) is to develop an Android application to help minesweepers in doing their job. It has to provide them with relevant data in a fast and well-thought way. [Digger DTR](https://dtr.digger.ch/dtr/), for the needs of a new project in collaboration with the [Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)](https://www.gichd.org/), has commissioned the project. Its goal is to adapt the existing system commercialised by Digger DTR that uses demining tanks to dog-assisted demining.

A demining dog handler needs the most current information delivered reliably in order to get the job done. The system that has been created is able to show a live map of the land mine, useful statistics and a number of simultaneous live streams coming from embedded cameras. The user is notified whenever the sensors on the dog warn about it being sited, meaning it has smelled the presence of a mine. The dog handler can transmit orders to his dog with the help of an audio connection between his handset and a speaker mounted on the dog.

The application that was developed satisfies the ergonomic exigency imposed by the client, which is a one-hand usable user interface. The user interface is designed so that the most frequently consulted information is accessible through the smallest amount of interaction.

As part of the project, an original graphical component has been created: the PieMenu. Its role is to provide a set of actions that can be triggered with only a single one-finger touch on the touchscreen.

The complete set of data shown on the Android application comes from the pre-existing Digger MSO application. The service as well as the network protocol capable of retrieving and delivering the information to the mobile tool were carried out for this specific project.

What has been achieved through this project complies with Digger’s requirements and will soon be used in real conditions in minefields of Bosnia and Cambodia.
