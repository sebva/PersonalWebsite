The Universal Digital Camera Interface Application (UDCI) was mandated by the [Space Exploration Institute](http://www.space-x.ch/) based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. The project takes place as part of the development of the CLUPI camera, scheduled to be sent to Mars with the ESA's [ExoMars](http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/) mission. The goal of the project is to develop an application for Windows 8.1 tablets to help engineers in the development of digital camera interfaces.

The application's main functionality consists in allowing an engineer working on digital camera interfaces to quickly craft or decode binary frames exchanged with a camera ongoing testing. It is also capable of decoding images coming from the camera. It can then display them on an interactive graphical interface. The user can query individual pixels of the image and know about their color and position.

The project is realized as part of the R&D Workshop Master’s course taught at the University of Neuchâtel.
