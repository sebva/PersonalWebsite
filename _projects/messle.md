Messle for iPhone is an application enabling people to send and receive geo-localized messages. In traditional social network, like Facebook or Twitter, the criteria to show messages of other people is a following or friendship link. With Messle, the criteria is proximity and age of messages.

When a user sends a message, every other user located in a configurable range can see it. Multimedia content can be attached to text messages.

The iPhone application was developed by myself. The server component and the showcase website were developed by [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini) and Malik Lechekhab, respectively. The project consisted in our CFC diploma project and got distinguished as one of the best 10 throughout Switzerland.
